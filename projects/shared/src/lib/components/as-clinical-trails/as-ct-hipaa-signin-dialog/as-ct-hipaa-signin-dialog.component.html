            Quest Diagnostics has set up a database of potential research study participants who have agreed to receive
            communications from us about research studies (“Research Database”). A research study is a scientific
            project carefully designed to answer certain questions in an organized and reliable way. Research studies
            can be as simple as a survey or as complex as testing new healthcare treatments to see if they are safe and
            effective for human use. Quest Diagnostics includes information in the Research Database only from
            individuals who have given us their permission to do so. By agreeing to this Authorization, you give your
            permission to Quest Diagnostics Incorporated and its wholly owned subsidiaries (“Quest Diagnostics”) to
            collect, use and disclose your protected health information (“PHI”) for purposes related to the Research
            Database as described in this form.</p>
          <p>This Authorization applies to the following PHI: your first and last name, contact information, prior
            and/or
            future laboratory testing results and information indicating or suggesting you may have a medical
            condition(s). This PHI may include demographic information, diagnosis codes associated with laboratory test
            orders, and/or geographic information. If your PHI includes information about genetic, alcohol and/or drug
            abuse treatment, HIV or diseases that can be transmitted from one person to another, this Authorization may
            apply to that information as well. You authorize Quest Diagnostics to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Include your PHI in the Research Database;</li>
            <li>Use your PHI to assess whether you might be eligible to participate in research studies;</li>
            <li>Use your PHI to inform you about research study opportunities;</li>
            <li>Use your PHI to invite you to participate in clinical research pre-qualification surveys; and</li>
            <li>If you elect to participate in a pre-qualification survey Quest Diagnostics will rely on this
              Authorization
              to disclose relevant PHI to the clinical research site affiliated with the applicable clinical research
              study.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Your name, date of birth, email, address and phone number(s) will be used to verify your identity and
            associated PHI for inclusion in the Research Database and to notify you of potential research opportunities.
            Your gender, race and ethnicity are not required; if you choose to provide this information, we may use it
            to notify you of any opportunities to participate in clinical trials for conditions that may be more
            prevalent in individuals of a particular gender, race or ethnicity or in which certain races, ethnicities or
            genders are underrepresented.</p>
          <p>We may contact you via mail, email or on your home or mobile phone using the information provided. We will
            only use the email address you provide to send you unencrypted emails about clinical trials as described in
            the Authorization. Unencrypted emails are not a secure method of communication because they may be accessed
            or intercepted by third parties. These emails may contain information about clinical trials based upon your
            laboratory test results. That means if you provide a work email address or a shared email address, your
            employer or any individual with whom you share an email account may be able to access the email.</p>
          <p>Please notify us of any changes to your contact information, so that we may continue to deliver required
            notices, disclosures and records and so that we do not provide such information to an incorrect location or
            recipient.</p>
          <p>The fact that Quest Diagnostics informs you about a research study does not necessarily mean that you have
            a particular diagnosis or medical condition.</p>
          <p class="text-wrap">This Authorization becomes effective upon your signature and shall not expire until Quest Diagnostics ends
            the Research Database, or until you revoke this Authorization. You may revoke this Authorization at any
            time, except to the extent that action has been taken in reliance on it, by notifying Quest Diagnostics in
            writing at <b>ClinicalTrialsHIPAA@QuestDiagnostics.com</b>.</p>
          <p>It is entirely your choice whether to agree to this Authorization. Quest Diagnostics may not condition
            treatment, payment, enrollment in a health plan, or eligibility for benefits on whether you agree to this
            Authorization. PHI released under the terms of this Authorization may be re-disclosed and may no longer be
            protected by federal or state confidentiality laws.</p>
          <p>In connection with obtaining this Authorization and the collection, use and/or disclosure of your PHI as
            described above, Quest Diagnostics will receive payments from sponsors or other third parties involved in
            research studies.</p>
